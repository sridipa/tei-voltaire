      <h2>How Candide was brought up in a magnificent castle,
         and how he was expelled thence</h2>

      <p>In a castle of <span class="placeName">
            Westphalia</span>, lived a youth whom nature had endowed with
         the most agreeable manners. His face was the index of his mind.
         He had a solid judgment joined to the most unaffected simplicity;
         and hence, I presume, he had his name of
         <span class="persName">Candide</span>.</p>
      <p>The old servants of the family suspected him to have been the son
         of <span class="persName">the Baron</span>'s sister, by a
         good, honest gentleman of the neighborhood, whom that young lady
         refused to marry, because he could only produce threescore and
         eleven quarterings in his arms; the rest of the genealogical tree
         belonging to the family having been lost through the injuries of time.</p>
      <p>The <span class="persName">Baron</span> was one of the most
         powerful lords in <span class="placeName">
            Westphalia</span>, for his castle had a gate and several windows,
         and his great hall was even hung with tapestry.</p>
      <p>The <span class="persName">Baroness</span>, who weighed
         three hundred and fifty pounds, consequently was a person of great
         consideration, and she did the honours of the house with a dignity
         that commanded universal respect.</p>
      <p>Her daughter <span class="persName">Cunégonde</span> was
         seventeen years of age, fresh-coloured, comely, plump, and
         desirable.</p>
      <p>The Baron's son appeared in every respect worthy of his father.
         The Preceptor <span class="persName">Pangloss</span> was the
         oracle of the family, and little
         <span class="persName">Candide</span> listened to his
         instructions with all the good faith of his age and
         character.</p>
      <p><span class="persName">Pangloss</span> taught
         metaphysico-theologo-cosmolo-nigology. He could prove to admiration
         that there is no effect without a cause; and, that in this best of
         all possible worlds, the
         <span class="persName">Baron</span>'s castle was the most
         magnificent of all castles, and My Lady the best of all possible
         baronesses.</p>
      <p>It is demonstrable, said he, that things cannot be otherwise than
         as they are; for as all things have been created for some end, they
         must necessarily be created for the best end. Observe, for instance,
         the nose is formed for spectacles, therefore we wear spectacles.</p>
      <p><span class="persName">Candide</span>, convinced of this
         doctrine, believed that
         <span class="persName">Cunégonde</span> was a great beauty,
         though he had never had the boldness to tell her so. He concluded
         that after the happiness of being born of
         <span class="persName">Baron Thunder-ten-tronckh</span>,
         the second degree of happiness was to be
         <span class="persName">Miss Cunégonde</span>, the third that
         of seeing her every day, and the fourth that of hearing
         <span class="persName">Doctor Pangloss</span>, the greatest
         philosopher of the whole province, and consequently of the whole
         world.</p>
      <p>One day <span class="persName">Cunégonde</span>, while
         walking near the castle, in a little wood which they called a park,
         saw between the bushes, Dr.
         <span class="persName">Pangloss</span> giving a lesson in
         experimental natural philosophy to her mother's chamber-maid, a
         little brown wench, very pretty and very docile.</p>
      <p>As <span class="persName">Miss Cunégonde</span> had a
         great disposition for the sciences, she breathlessly observed the
         repeated experiments of which she was a witness; she clearly
         perceived the force of the Doctor's reasons, the effects, and the
         causes; she turned back greatly flurried, quite pensive, and filled
         with the desire of knowledge, imagining that she might be a
         sufficiently reason for young
         <span class="persName">Candide</span>, and he for her.</p>
      <p>She met <span class="persName">Candide</span> on reaching
         the castle and blushed; he blushed also; she wished him good morning
         with a faltering voice, and he wished her good morning with equal
         embarrassment. The next day, after dinner, as they were rising from
         table, <span class="persName">Cunégonde</span> and
         <span class="persName">Candide</span> found themselves
         behind a screen;
         <span class="persName">Cunégonde</span> let fall her
         handkerchief, <span class="persName">Candide</span> picked
         it up, she innocently took hold of his hand, and he as innocently
         kissed hers with a warmth, a sensibility, a grace — all very
         particular; their lips met, their eyes sparkled, their knees
         trembled, their hands strayed.</p>
      <p>The <span class="persName">Baron Thunder-ten-tronckh</span>
         passed near the screen and beholding this cause and effect, expelled
         <span class="persName">Candide</span> from the castle with
         great kicks. <span class="persName">Cunégonde</span> fainted
         away, and as soon as she came to herself, the
         <span class="persName">Baroness</span> boxed her ears. Thus
         a general consternation was spread over this most magnificent and
         most agreeable of all possible castles.</p>
